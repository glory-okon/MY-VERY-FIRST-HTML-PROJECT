This was my very first html project
i learnt about TAGS, ELEMENTS, ATTRIBUTES, PROPERTIES/VALUES ETC
I learnt about Divs, legend, inputs, fieldset, label, value, text area, button.
most importantly, I learnt how to structure me Html doc; DOCTYPE, head, title, meta, body etc
JUST SEEING WHAT I COULD ACHIEVE MADE ME WANT TO KNOW MORE

And i had done these projects way before i learnt of github and how to host my websites online.
